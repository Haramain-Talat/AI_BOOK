## Core Principles

### Academic Rigor
All content must meet university-level academic standards with clear learning outcomes, concept explanations, and practical examples; diagrams must be accurately described in text

### Documentation-First
Every chapter must be written in Markdown format with structured content including concept explanation, learning outcomes, diagrams, and practical examples

### Docusaurus Framework
The documentation system must use Docusaurus for generating the textbook with proper navigation, table of contents, and deployable to GitHub Pages

### Output-Centric
Focus on correct output generation rather than implementation steps; ensure proper generation of docs folder, sidebars.js, and docusaurus.config.js

### Structured Content
Content style must be academic, structured, clean, and suitable for university-level education

### Deployment Ready
All generated content must be deployable using GitHub Pages with proper homepage, sidebar navigation, and table of contents

## Technology Requirements

Docusaurus framework, GitHub Pages deployment, Markdown format for chapters, automated generation of navigation files

## Content Standards

Each chapter must include concept explanation, learning outcomes, diagrams described in text, and practical examples

## Governance

Constitution governs all content generations; amendments require documentation and approval; all chapters must comply with academic and structural requirements
